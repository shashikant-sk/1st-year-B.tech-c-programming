// Create a base class called Shape with two data members of double type which could be used to
// compute the area of figures. Derive two specific classes called Triangle and Rectangle from the
// base class Shape. Add to the base class, a member function called GetData to initialize base
// class data members and another member function displayArea to compute and display the area
// of figures. Make displayArea a virtual function and redefine this function in the derived classes
// to suit their requirements. Using these three classes design a program which will accept
// dimensions of a triangle or rectangle interactively and display the area.
