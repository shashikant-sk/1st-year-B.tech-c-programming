// A matrix m × n that has relatively few non-zero entries is called sparse matrix. It may be represented in much less than m × n space. 
// An m × n matrix with k non-zero entries is sparse if k << m × n. 
// It may be faster to represent the matrix compactly as a list of the non-zero indexes and associated entries. WAP to represent a sparse matrix using linked list.
